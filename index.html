    <p>
        Ever since I was a young girl, I have always desired to be eloquent in language and especially the English language. Having been raised in a rural area, surrounded by people who only communicate in my first language, the challenge to achieve competence was great. The school opened great doors for me to interact with like-minded people and those who were great in the language.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am passionate about nurturing young minds to achieve the confidence they need to communicate well and not only communicate but to be understood. This is why I pursued a bachelor's degree in English and Literature, with a special interest in applied linguistics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also passionate about technology and curious to learn more about how to use technology as a medium of education. I am also interested in educating the youth on how to present their ideas using the English language. I am also curious to learn about web development and how to visualize ideas into visuals which is one of the goals of Techlit Africa. Techlit Africa will offer a great stepping stone in my career as an educator. Being an educator has equipped me with techniques on how to teach language, manage students, formulate a lesson plan and also classroom control among others.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of Techlit Africa aligns with my ambitions as an educator. Changing the lives of young people through education. And what better way to reach the current generation than through technology?
